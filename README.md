# Exercise-4-Project-Euler-problem-5-

##Based on [Orginalproblem](https://projecteuler.net/problem=5)

# I first re-created the Original problem for numbers 1 to 10 in Python and got the answer 2,520.
# Knowing, my logis and maths was correct, I then I added the FOR and RANGE commands. Name of this script was Exe4range.py
# Lastly, I changed the number range to be 1 - 20. As this took a good while to run, I then added comments to say 'Program started' to let the user know that the script was actually runing.
